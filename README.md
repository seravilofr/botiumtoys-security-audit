# Botium Toys - Security Audit
This is a mock audit done within the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course as a first project. 
This audit is pretty straightforward and aims to teach us :
  - how to realize a first cybersecurity project and to include it in our portfolio
  - how a security audit is made and what are the questions and matters to look for
