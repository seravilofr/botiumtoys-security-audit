# Botium Toys - Security Audit
This is a mock audit done within the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course as a first project. 

This audit is pretty easy and straightforward and aims to teach us :
  - how to realize a first cybersecurity project and to include it in our portfolio
  - how a security audit is made and what are the questions and matters to look for

In this project I reviewed the scope, goals and risk assessment report to understand what should be included in a security audit report and compared them to the situation laid out in the scenario. Errors or lack of precisions within the report were corrected. 
Then, I took the Controls and compliance checklist to assess whether or not appropriate controls were in place and relevant laws and regulations were respected (mainly Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, GDPR and System and Organizations Controls type 1 & 2). With those elements in mind I could then make suggestions as to what controls the company should improve or put into place to address the compliance and security issues.

<h2>Scenario:</h2>

*This scenario is based on a fictional company.*

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
